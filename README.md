# Smart-grid-energy-demand-forecasting
This project aims to predict future energy demand in a smart grid system using historical electricity consumption data. By analyzing past power usage patterns, the model forecasts upcoming energy requirements, helping utility providers optimize electricity distribution and reduce energy wastage.

Machine Learning algorithms such as ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks) are used to model the time-dependent nature of the data. The system learns seasonal trends, daily usage cycles, and external factors like temperature or holidays to make accurate predictions.

The final output is a web-based dashboard (Flask/Streamlit) that visualizes historical energy demand and displays real-time future forecasts, enabling smart and efficient energy management.
